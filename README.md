## Job Portal Development

This section delves into the Job Portal platform.The project features a comprehensive set of functionalities designed to optimize job-related actions and user experience. A key highlight is the "like" system, implemented for both job listings and user profiles, fostering user engagement.

**Comprehensive Functionality:**

* **Effortless Job Posting:**
    * The **postJob** functionality empowers recruiters to seamlessly create new job postings within the platform, streamlining the job listing process for a user-friendly experience.
* **Streamlined Job Applications:**
    * The **applyJob** controller and its corresponding repository functions allow users of diverse types (e.g., "student," "fresher," "experienced," and "recruiter") to efficiently apply for job openings. Robust error handling mechanisms prevent duplicate submissions.
* **Engaging User Interaction with "Like" System:**
    * A "like" system fosters user engagement by allowing users to express interest in specific job postings or other applicants' profiles.
* **Data-Driven User Interactions:**
    * The **getLikes** functionality enables efficient retrieval of user "likes" associated with specific job listings or profiles. MongoDB serves as the foundation for storing and managing user interaction data effectively, ensuring scalability and efficient access.
